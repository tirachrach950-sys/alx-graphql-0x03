# ErrorBoundary Implementation

This project demonstrates how to implement and use an Error Boundary
in a Next.js + TypeScript application.

Features:
- Custom ErrorBoundary class component
- Global error handling via _app.tsx
- Test component that throws an error intentionally

This follows React best practices for runtime error handling.
